# DeepCool_AI 

**Hybrid RL + LSTM AI for Energy-Efficient Data Center Cooling**

---

## Overview

DeepCool_AI is an advanced AI system designed to **optimize data center cooling** using a combination of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
The AI predicts rack inlet temperatures and dynamically adjusts cooling setpoints, significantly **reducing energy consumption** while maintaining safe operational limits.

>  Key Impact: Reduced energy waste and prevented overheating events in real-time.

## Features

- **LSTM Forecaster**: Predicts future rack inlet temperatures from historical data.
- **RL Agent (PPO)**: Learns an optimal cooling strategy to minimize energy cost.
- **Hybrid System**: Combines prediction + control for efficient and safe cooling.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots, GIFs, and videos to monitor performance.
- **Metrics**: Tracks overheating events and average cooling setpoints.
